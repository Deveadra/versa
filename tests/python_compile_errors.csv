base/io/run_voice.py,39,41,unexpected character after line continuation character,"reply = ""; "".join(f\""{src} {rel} {tgt}\"" for src, rel, tgt in relations)",utf-8
FIX: The problem is caused by the use of incorrect escape characters (\") for string literals; you should use regular double quotes (") or single quotes (') for f-strings in Python.
reply = "; ".join(f"{src} {rel} {tgt}" for src, rel, tgt in relations)
