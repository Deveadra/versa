- Add a voice interrupt manager that can cut off simpleaudio playback on command

- Mood Engine: mood-driven recall strategies

- Future GUI Compatibility

Later when you build a GUI, you won’t need to touch the logic again.
The GUI just toggles settings.auto_speak:

# In your GUI code
```bash
from config.config import settings

def toggle_voice(enabled: bool):
    settings.auto_speak = enabled
```

- keep initial_habits around for seeding/bootstrapping, just keep it in a variable but don’t pass it here. You can later do:

```bash
for h in initial_habits:
    # maybe seed or log
    print(f"[Seed habit] {h}")
```
